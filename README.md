# LGI

LGI is gobject-introspection based dynamic Lua binding to GObject
based libraries.  It allows using GObject-based libraries directly
from Lua.

Home of the project is on [GitHub](http//github.com/pavouk/lgi).

## Installation:

In order to be able to compile native part of lgi,
gobject-introspection >= 0.10.8 development package must be installed,
although preferred version is >= 1.30.  The development package is
called `libgirepository1.0-dev` on debian-based systems (like Ubuntu)
and `gobject-introspection-devel` on RedHat-based systems (like Fedora).

Using LuaRocks:

    luarocks install lgi

Alternatively, use make-based installation:

    make
    [sudo] make install [PREFIX=<prefix>] [DESTDIR=<destdir>]

Please note that on BSD-systems you may need to use 'gmake'.

## Usage

See examples in samples/ directory.  Documentation is available in
doc/ directory in markdown format.  Process it with your favorite

## History

### unreleased

- existing Gtk overrides reworked and improved, there is now a way to
  describe and create widget hierarchies in Lua-friendly way.  See
  `docs/gtk.lua`, chapter about `Gtk.Container` for overview and
  samples.

### 0.3 (28-Nov-2011)

- Project hosting moved to GitHub.
- Build system switched from `waf` to simple Makefile-based one
- Added automatic locking of thread-sensitive libraries (Gdk and
  Clutter).  There is no need to add `Gdk.threads_enter()`,
  `Gdk.threads_leave()` and `Clutter.threads_enter()`,
  `Clutter.threads_leave()` pairs into application, lgi handles this
  automatically.
- Added new sample `samples/console.lua`, which implements already
  quite usable Lua console using Gtk widgets.
- Fixes for compatibility with older gobject-introspection 0.10.8
  package
- Testsuite is not built automatically, because building it can be
  apparently problematic on some systems, causing installation failure
  even when testsuite is not needed at all.
- Remove `setlocale()` initialization, which could break Lua when used
  with some regional locales.  The downside of this change is that
  marshaling file names containing non-ASCII characters on systems
  which define `G_BROKEN_FILENAMES` environment variable (probably
  only Fedora 15) does not work now.
